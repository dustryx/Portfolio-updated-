          "Thanks for stopping by! I'm a junior full-stack developer from Nairobi, Kenya, passionate about creating eye-catching websites and exploring innovative ideas. My journey started with a Diploma in ICT from Kabete National Polytechnic, and I've recently completed my software engineering training as a full-stack developer at Moringa School. I discovered my true passion for programming (and occasionally UI/UX) and now enjoy solving real-world problems with code while connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts.

Beyond coding, I love watching TV shows, traveling, taking nature walks, and diving into a good book ðŸ¤“. I'm always on the lookout for new reads, so feel free to share any recommendations! âœ¨"
